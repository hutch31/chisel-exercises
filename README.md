Chisel Exercises
================

## Overview

This repository contains a series of exercises for learning Chisel.  Each exercise introduces new concepts in
the language.

These exercises describe some parts of the Chisel language, but are not intended to be a manual or stand-alone
reference to the language.  Users should refer to [Digital Design with Chisel](https://www.imm.dtu.dk/~masca/chisel-book.pdf)
for a more comprehensive reference.

The [Chisel Cookbook](https://www.chisel-lang.org/chisel3/docs/cookbooks/cookbook.html) has references on specific 
cases and their answers.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

The first exercise introduces basic language concepts such as inputs and outputs, Wire and Reg declarations,
and putting these together to form a working design.  It also has a simple introduction to unit testing.
