Exercise 4
==========

The objective of exercise 4 is to instantiate and connect to a module.  This will also cover how to connect to
ports in a module and the bundle connect operator *<>*.  The solution for this objective is more complex, and 
will require you to use the items from Exercises 1-3 as well.

## Language Background

Modules are declared in Chisel by creating a new object and wrapping it in a Module() call.  The object must be
a subclass of the chisel3.Module class.  Once the module has been declared, its IO ports are accessible using
dot notation.

```scala
  val myModule = Module(new MyModule)

  myModule.io.dataIn := localDataIn
  localDataOut := myModule.io.dataOut
```

When signals are grouped together in a bundle, we can connect all the signals in the bundle using the *<>* operator.
This connects signals by name, respecting the individual direction of signals when connecting.  This is very useful
when connecting Decoupled interfaces.

```scala
  module.a <> io.a

  // the equivalent of the above operator
  module.a.valid := io.a.valid
  module.a.bits := io.a.bits
  io.a.ready := module.a.ready
```
